## Introduction

**SParry** is a shortest path calculating **Python** tool using some algorithms with **CUDA** to speedup.

It's **developing**.

------

`SParry` is a **shortest path calculation toolkit**, the main shortest path algorithms, including `Dijkstra`, `Bellman-Ford`, `Delta-Stepping`, and `Edge-Based`, are encapsulated.  **A parallel accelerated version based on CUDA is provided** to improve development efficiency.

At the same time, `SParry` can divide the graph data into parts, and solve it more quickly than using the CPU when the graph is too large to put it in the GPU directly.

## Test&Result

We have conducted a lot of tests on this tool, and no errors occurred in the test results. We have counted the time consumption and serial-parallel speedup ratio of each algorithm on some graphs to solve the **single-source shortest path (SSSP) and all-pairs shortest path (APSP)**. The following shows the time variation of each algorithm with the number of nodes when the average degree is 4, please refer to [SParry/testResult](testResult) .

#### In File

When your graph data is stored in a **file** and **meets the data requirements** ([file data](tutorials.md#file-format)) , you can also pass in a file to calculate the shortest path.

The file in this example is as follows, `test.txt` .

```
4 6
0 1 1
0 2 2
0 3 3
1 2 2
1 3 3
2 3 4

```

code is below:

```python
>>> from calc import calc
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from pretreat import read
>>>
>>> filename = "./data/test.txt" # the path to the file where the graph data is stored
>>> graph = read(filename = filename, # the data passed in is the file
...              method = "spfa", # the algorithm used is spfa
...              detail = True, # record the details of the graph
...              directed = False) # the graph is an undirected graph
>>> # calculated shortest path 
>>> res = calc(graph = graph, # the incoming graph data class
...            useCUDA = True, # use CUDA parallel acceleration
...            srclist = 0) # source point is node 0
>>>
>>> res.dist # output shortest path
array([0, 1, 2, 3], dtype=int32)
>>>
>>> print(res.display()) # print related parameters
